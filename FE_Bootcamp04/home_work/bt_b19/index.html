            <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, which are the seeds of berries from the Coffea plant.</p>
            <p>The genus Coffea is pnative to tropical Africa (specifically having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) and Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius, and Réunion in the Indian Ocean.</p>
            <p>The plant was exported from Africa to countries around the world.</p>
            <p>Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, India, and Africa.</p>
            <p>The two most commonly grown are arabica and robusta.</p>
            <p>Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried.</p>
            <p>Dried coffee seeds (referred to as beans) are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor</p>
            <p>Roasted beans are ground and brewed with near-boiling water to produce coffee as a beverage.</p>
